## Prerequisites
The collection of scripts rely on [SPICE](https://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/naif/aboutspice.html) from NASA's Navigation and Ancilliary Information Facility. The MATLAB implementation of the SPICE toolkit is available for download from the [NAIF website](https://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/naif/toolkit_MATLAB.html). SPICE is used to retrieve the state vector information of the planetary bodies of interest and their physical parameters (size and gravitaional parameter). Please refer to the
