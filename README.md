## Dependencies
The collection of scripts rely on the [SPICE toolkit](https://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/naif/aboutspice.html) from NASA's Navigation and Ancilliary Information Facility. The MATLAB implementation of the SPICE toolkit is available for download from the [NAIF website](https://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/naif/toolkit_MATLAB.html). SPICE is used to retrieve the state vector information of the planetary bodies of interest and their physical parameters (size and gravitaional parameter). A strong undertanding of SPICE is not necessary for successful use of this program. Please refer to the SPICE [documentation](https://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/naif/documentation.html) and [tutorials](https://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/naif/tutorials.html) for installation information.
